                <p>Welcome To My Website.</p>
                <p>
                   My name is Stephen Prahl, I am from Trenton, NJ. I however, packed up and decided
                   to move here to Pensylvania about six months ago. It was the best decision i've 
                   made in a very long time, if not my entire life, if thats even how you spell entire. aha.
                   Since then, I've moved from the far side of PA near Ohio over to the coast of PA near NJ.
                   I gave up the beach for the mountains and as an artist and musician i feel like i made a good 
                   decision on doing so. I always wanted to be a music teacher so i attended Julliard in NYC when 
                   i was 13 and graduated at the age of 17. I moved back to NJ where i realized years later its not
                   where i was meant to be, my uncles are both Data Scientists and one is a Professor at Las Vegas
                   University. Growing up i always loved computers, even tho as a kid we only had ms dos.
