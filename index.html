                <h1>Why Coding Temple?</h1>
                <strong><small>Achieving The Impossible</small></strong> 
                    <p>Since i was a child i've always wanted to be some sort of computer engineer when i grew up. My uncle Mike was a professor
                        at Princeton University In New Jersey for Computer Science & Engineering. Now he teachas at Las Vegas Universeity as one. My other
                        unce Mark was and is still a Data Management Engineer. When i was a kid i used to go in their rooms and sit on the bed and watch them
                        study for school and watch them as they did their school work on MS Dos. My have the times changed, reminds me of a great classic by
                        Bob Dylan, Times Are A Changing. Technology has done a few mean spins and definately quantum leaped about a thousand years ahead of itself.
                        just 20 years ago i remember flipping open an old flip phone made of 4 feet of plastic with a ringer that would challenge even
                        the best loud speakers. I remember a few months ago going online and scrolling on google and seeing something about a company called Simplified,
                        so i signed up out of a whim and it lead me to NuCamp, another bootcamp school. And then when i went to apply it sent me to Ascend
                        which is a loan company which then sent tme to a list of schools i was eligable for and i did my research and decided out of the 5 
                        different schools i could attend that id choose Coding Temple, and man am i seriously glad i did. These guys are super great people,
                        they are always willing to help you through anything you are struggling with. And the first real convorsation i had with anyone personally was
                        with kevin after scheduling a 1on1 zoom session because anaconda wouldnt install on my external drive and we had a great convorsation, it was
                        more like shooting squirelles with your friends back at home, we just rambled about tech and about how times have changed and we also covered
                        a whole lot of very interesting concepts meanwhile achieving the solution to my install error issue. It was relaxing knowing the staff arent
                        crazy ppl with hidden agendas, i really appriciate the authenticity of the staff and their goals as teachers. Thank you all once again.

                    </figure>
                    <p> I've never heard of Python in my life, so i dove in head first and almost broke my neck in the process but hey i brought my floatys
                        so you  cant say i didnt come prepared to swim the sharks. I was freaking out when i realized how little i know about programming
                        and how much everyone else in our class knows compared to me. It's very intimidating but i do very well under pressure so i will adapt
                        and i will learn from everyone in my class as well as the staff. Syntax, Strings, Value, Variable, all those different functions i had
                        no idea about yet soaked up like a sponge. I am still struggling, like with Github, im still tryna figure out how to update my current
                        projects to my repository. However im not worried about it bc i'll just message staff on slack and they will guide me through it for the 
                        third time. haha. Also im using a horrible Ematic laptop i bought off amazon for like $100 so now we both know how horrible this PC is.
                        So far i can honestly say i am very happy about learning these programs and meeting new and interesting people along the way.
                        so many people in this world take for granted how important every single day is to our lives, you can achieve and lose an unlimited
                        amount of opportunity within 24 hours. Yet life goes on, with or without us. So, i do know one thing that i am absolutely certain of,
                        and that is my decision a couple months ago to tell my boss at my old job hey i need to take this call its important and signed up
                        for this school. Im stressed, im anxious, but im willing and im passionate about passing this course and using everything i learn
                        to get a better career, one i actually really enjoy doing. And providing for myself and my family in the future. It's been a bit rough
                        learning everything at such a rapid rate but im learning fast and that i do know for sure. I'm happy at where im at in my life, im a bit
                        uncomfortable with the city and home where i live but being uncomfortable is a very important aspect of living, in order to get to where 
                        we need to be in life we need to be uncomfortable. And with that said my experience so far is FRICK FRACKIN AMAZINGGGGG.!!!

                <strong><small>Time Is Of The Essence</small></strong>
                    <p>I honestly dont even know where to begin on this subject. All i do know is that a month ago i was struggling
                        just to install certain programs on my PC that are required for school. As i was watching the Intro To Software
                        Engineering tutorial videos i felt as i was about to stroke out because i had no idea what i was getting myself
                        into, but i wasnt going to let that dim my ambition to conquer coding. My first two classes during week_0 that i attended
                        i could barely keep up, everything was going so fast i could barely write notes or code a long. However, i did learn
                        certain things here and there that are extremely important and thankfully for the awesome staff at Coding Temple i went
                        on our class page and downloaded all the videos and since we've had off the last 3 days ive endulged into them like noboys
                        buisness. Pretty sure thats not actually how you spell buisness but you get my drift. Ive learned how to create a web Page
                        and ive even learned out to design them thanks to css and the CT Staff once again.

                <h1>Fast Forward</h1>
                <strong><small>To Infinity & Beyond</small></strong>
                    <p>Well, I've come to realize that you cant speed up the  time no matter how badly you would like to do so.
                        Everything we do right now here in the present eventually after dissapearing into space and time ultimately
                        comes back around in the future with the same energy that you put out. I strongly believe that the quantum
                        world has a mind of its own. Nothing seems to make a diffence until consciousness actually acknowledges that nothing.
                        Then that nothing becomes someting, with that in mind the nothing then becomes something even when we dont seems 
                        to understand it. The future of our lives is a result on decisions made by us in our past. Six months ago i had 
                        no idea i'd be enrolled in Coding Temple learning crazy amounts of Python, HTML, CSS, and all the ins and outs
                        that i have recently endeavored. The satisfaction is beyond definition, the little time i took to get enrolled
                        was a monumental achievement for me. Tho i stand at the bottom of the mountain gazing upward searching for the peak
                        in which is lost in the clouds i stand inspired, ambitious, and determined to conquer this mountain. No matter how long
                        it takes or how hard things get, i will not quit, i will not fail. FROM MIND, TO HEART, AND THEN TO REALITY.
